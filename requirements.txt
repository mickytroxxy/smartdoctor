Project Name: PlayMyJam
Description:
PlayMyJam is a mobile app designed for pub and club goers to request and bid for songs to be played by DJs in real time. The app creates an interactive experience by allowing users to buy tokens, bid for their favorite songs, and even generate AI music to be played. DJs manage requests through a dedicated dashboard, while club owners and admins monitor transactions, song approvals, and earnings.

The app includes location-based features to find participating clubs, a leaderboard for top DJs, and a merchandise store that sells branded T-shirts and caps with QR codes.

The primary goal of PlayMyJam is to enhance the nightlife experience by giving customers control over the music while allowing DJs to maximize engagement and earnings.
